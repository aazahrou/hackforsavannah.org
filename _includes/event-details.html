          <h5>How will it work?</h5>

          <p>Participants will work in teams of no more than five (5) individuals over two days to develop civic-tech product
            and startup ideas that make a difference, with an additional prize bracket for the team with the best functional
            prototype. Winning teams will receive a total of $6K in cash prizes, courtesy of the generosity of Savannnah
            Economic Development Authority (SEDA). The general theme will revolve around 'Urban Resilliency and Disaster Response,' but a more specific challenge will be assigned at the event kickoff.</p>
