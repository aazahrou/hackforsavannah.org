### New dates for event Oct. 20-22, 2017

We had everything lined up and ready to go for Hack for Savannah when the various spaghetti models all depicted Hurricane Irma – which was at the time the most powerful and largest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic – making initial landfall squarely in the center of Savannah. Luckily for Savannah, the storm didn't veer north as quickly as predicted and we mostly escaped its wrath.

our region hasn't been hammered by a major hurricane's direct impact since 1893. This has led The Weather Channel to declare Savannah as the top "U.S. City overdue for a hurricane."

### Historic event

Join us for one of our meetups every Wednesday at Hacker Lab.
