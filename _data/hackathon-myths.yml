    When the term hackathon comes to mind, we tend to think solely of which team
    has the strongest <em>deliverable</em>. At their core, hackathons are about devising a feasible,
    effective, smart solution that involves far more than programming neat software.
    They require a strong pitch, a clear competitive advantage, and an in-depth analysis of the solution.

    This myth couldn't be further from the truth, and it creates a dangerous self-fulfilling prophecy
    when people opt not to participate simply because they don't <em>know how to CD into the root directory
    and CHMOD the file permissions to 755</em>. For true success, especially in a <em>civic</em> hackathon,
    a diversity of skillsets will be needed. Just because you can't write a complex JavaScript app using
    Angular 2 doesn't mean you can't contribute to the team's project meaningfully.

    Hackathons are ideal learning environments, testing your critical thinking skills and ability to solve
    problems creatively under tight deadlines. And if you haven't put much critical thought into <em>why</em>
    you would build something a certain way, it doesn't matter how sleek it is to use or what fancy new
    JavaScript framework it uses.

    While event volunteers will be at Bull Street Labs to assist teams in shifts throughout the entirety
    of the night, teams by no means <em>have</em> to stay at BSL or go without sleep to finish in time.
    Sleep is important. It makes the brain function quicker. Go home and rest Saturday night if you can.
    At the very least, get a quick shut-eye on a couch at BSL, if nothing else!
