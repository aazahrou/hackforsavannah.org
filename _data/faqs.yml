- title: What if I don't own a laptop?
  description: >-
    <p>If you don't have a laptop and would like to borrow one to use for the
    Hackathon, shoot an email to <a
    href="mailto:yall@opensavannah.org">yall@opensavannah.org</a> no later than
    Oct. 16. We will make every best effort to procure for you a loaner computer
    to use.</p>
- title: What is the challenge for the hackathon?
  description: >-
    <p>We won't reveal the precise challenge until the Friday evening kickoff
    event, but we will reveal the hackathon's theme â€“ urban resilliency and
    disaster response. That's all we can say. For now. Keep checking <a
    href="http://slack.opensavannah.org">Slack</a>, Open Savannah's <a
    href="http://forum.opensavannah.org">forum</a> and social media for easter
    eggs.</p>
- title: What are my transportation and/or parking options for the Hackathon?
  description: >-
    <p>Bull Street Labs is located in the Starland District of midtown Savannah.
    If taking public transit, the closest bus routes include the 4 Line, which
    stops at Barnard and 38th Streets, and either the 14 or the 11 lines, both
    of which stop at Abercorn and 38th Street (one block away).</p> <p>If
    driving, be sure not to park in the lot directly opposite the building, as
    that is a private lot. Generally, there will be plenty of street parking
    available that no street cleaning will take place on during the weekend, and
    you should have little trouble finding a spot near the location.</p>
- title: Is there an age requirement?
  description: >-
    <p>Absolutely not! We do require that all participants under the age of 21,
    however, allow organizers to place a bracelet on their arm during the
    reception denoting their underage status, and that any participants under
    the age of 16 have a parent or guardian sign off on their participation.</p>
- title: What if I'm not confident enough in my coding/design skills?
  description: >-
    <p>You have <em>absolutely</em> nothing to fear, and only knowledge to gain
    from participating in the hackathon. No one starts out in this world as a
    programming whiz; each of us has to learn somewhow. If you don't form a team
    ahead of time, we will make sure to place you with teammates with
    complimentary levels of technology acumen, pairing up new coders with
    professional developers and assigning dedicated Team Mentors to assist in
    the learning process.</p> <p>Open Savannah aims to create a safe space for
    participants of all skill levels, sexes, races, creeds, political beliefs,
    sexual orientation and gender orientation. If you fear at any point that
    anyone in the hackathon is 'looking down on you' or not valuing what you
    have to contribute because of your skillset or because of any other reason,
    be certain to consult our <a
    href="https://opensavannah.org/codeofconduct">Code of Conduct</a>, and
    report <strong>any and all</strong> potential violations to the Core
    Leadership team by emailing <a
    href="mailto:yall@opensavannah.org">yall@opensavannah.org</a>. The report
    will be dealt with in a swift, discrete and professional manner.</p>
- title: I want to participate, but I'm unable to attend that weekend. How else can I help?
  description: >-
    <p>Great question! We're still actively scouting out local restaurants to provide in-kind donations for the meals and snacks for the weekend, so if you know a local restauranteur or you are one yourself, don't miss this opportunity to give to a <a href="https://opensavannah.org/what-we-believe">forward-thinking civic cause</a> and help out a fast-growing <a href="https://meetup.com/opensavannah">community of nearly 200 residents.</a> </p><p>Alternatively, if you support our core mission of restoring civic engagement through technology, open data and digital inclusion and want to help defray event costs, <a href="https://secure.codeforamerica.org/page/contribute/default?brigade=Savannah%20Brigade">we welcome donations of all sizes</a>, and we'll publicly acknowledge your contribution with your consent. All donations are tax-exempt.
- title: I have relevant experience in community planning, disaster relief, environmental engineeering, climate research, meteorology, resiliency, civil service, public health or nonprofit-sector work, and I'd like to share my perspective/ideas at the event so that it might help inform the projects. Would I be welcome?
     description: >-
    <p>You certainly would! Throughout the weekend, beginning with the Friday evening panel, we hope to give speaking time to the perspectives of as many different diverse stakeholders as possible. </a> </p>
